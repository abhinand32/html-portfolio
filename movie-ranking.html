<h1>My Favourite Movies</h1>
<h2>Here is the top 3 movies according to me</h2>
<hr>
<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>Tha Batman series was always had some sort of lacking until Christopher NOlan stepped in to make the ultimate superhero movie of all time. Out of 3 movies he directed, the second one is the best as it has everything a movie needs to be perfect, a good protagnist, an equal antagonist, the perfect script, background score.</p>
<h3>Maheshinte Prathikaram</h3>
<p>The best Mollywood movie ever made according to me and Dileesh Pothan deserves every award for making this film. The storyline is very simple yet keeps us entertained thoughtout without a single second of boredom. </p>
<h3>CID Moosa</h3>
<p>Dileep in his prime was an undefeated champion. His movies were assured blockbusters. Durung that time came along CID Moosa which, after deacdes of it's initial release, remains a classic and is loved by older and younder audiences equally.  </p>
